ELOQNT APP:

Why:
As a restaurant manager, between bar/liquor inventories, restaurant supply inventories, and food inventories, I'd love there to be one centralized place for me to handle my stats and metrics. When we get a new liquor sku in, I'd love to easily add it to my store's master inventory along with price and units OH, and units sold. I'd also love to see and edit those metrics at will.

I like that I can see the overall costs for orders and have my items turn red when below the inventory levels we have set.

In addition, I enjoy having a place to leave notes for others looking at the inventory metrics. This system will make all future inventories easy, and we'll be able to train managers to quickly execute inventories more efficiently than we ever have.
